  For us there are only two possiblities: either we remain German or we come
  under the thumb of the Jews.  This latter must not occur; even if we are
  small, we are a force.  A well-organized group can conquer a strong enemy.
  If you stick close together and keep bringing in new people, we will be
  victorious over the Jews.
