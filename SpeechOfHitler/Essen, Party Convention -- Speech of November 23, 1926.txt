  . . . I WAS always particularly anxious to secure that Parteitag should on
  principle never be used for the settlement of personal disputes. Such disputes
  must certainly be settled in one way or another, but just as certainly the
  Parteitag which once in the year should unite the whole Movement, is not
  the fitting day for such a settlement. Neither is it the place at which to
  seek to clarify unripe and uncertain ideas. Neither the length of time available
  at such a gathering nor its nature admits of giving to it the character of
  a Council. And it must never be forgotten that in all such cases or those
  similar to them great decisions have not been made at such Councils: on the
  contrary, for the most part, world-history pursues its course without paying
  any attention to them. World-history, like all events of historical significance,
  is the result of the activity of single individuals - it is not the fruit
  of majority decisions....
